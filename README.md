# Deep PyTorch Super Resolution

A PyTorch 1.1.0 implementation of **SRCNN** **EDSR** neural networks for Super Resolution Single Frame tasks.

## Usage

Since the documentation is a *WIP* I suggest taking a look at the following files to figure out how to use my code:

1. `init_data.py`: starting from source data it performs some preprocessing (eg. RGB-to-GreyScale) and organizes examples and labels into a folder hierarchy.

2. `init_models.py`: performs training and testing of the two models and collects performance logs during all the operations.

3. `benchmark.py`: using pre trained models and performance data generated by the previous script, it compares the models and plots useful informations.
